# BharatScript

## Project Overview
**BharatScript** is a web application that allows users to transliterate text from one Indian script to another. Users can either point their phone camera at a street sign or upload a photo, and the app will recognize the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The script is automatically identified, and the text is converted into the user's preferred script without changing the meaning or pronunciation.  


This ensures that names of places and other text look different in writing but sound the same when read aloud, making it easy for anyone traveling to a new state to read local signboards clearly.

## Problem It Solves

When people travel to another state, reading local boards can be a challenge. **BharatScript** addresses this problem by:

- Displaying text in a script the user already knows.
- Saving time and reducing the stress of understanding unknown scripts.
- Preserving pronunciation so names of places are spoken correctly.
- Making travel smoother and more comfortable for frequent travelers.

---

## Innovation and Uniqueness
- Unlike translation apps, **BharatScript** keeps the original meaning and sound by only changing the script.
- Supports multiple Indian scripts in a single app â€” a rare feature.
- Real-time conversion using a phone camera (camera functionality is currently in progress).
- Works on both web and mobile platforms.

---

## Features
- Supports multiple Indian languages for transliteration.
- Converts typed or scanned text into the chosen language.
- Speaks out text using text-to-speech functionality.
- Easy-to-use interface for fast and accurate conversion.

---

## Current Status
- Web prototype with all features **except camera functionality** (in progress).
